      <h2>Archaea</h2>
      <p>
        Archaea are unicellular prokaryotic organisms similar to bacteria, but with distinct genetic 
        and biochemical characteristics. They are often found in extreme environments.

      Archaea are single-celled organisms without a true nucleus. Their cell walls do not contain 
      peptidoglycan, which distinguishes them from eubacteria. Archaea include extremophiles that thrive 
      in environments such as hot springs, salty lakes, acidic waters, and deep-sea hydrothermal vents. 
      They can be autotrophic, producing their own food, or heterotrophic, consuming organic material.
    </p>

    <p class="info" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, sans-serif;">
      Although Archaea were once thought to be bacteria, they are now recognized as a separate domain of life. 
      They play important roles in ecosystems, including nitrogen cycling and methane production. 
      Studying Archaea helps scientists understand evolution, the adaptability of life, 
      and potential applications in biotechnology.
